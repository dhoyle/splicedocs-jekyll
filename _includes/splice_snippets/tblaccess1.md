System tables are part of the `SYS` schema, to which access is restricted for security purposes. You can only access tables in the `SYS` schema if you are a Database Administrator or if your Database Administrator has explicitly granted access to you.

Many system table have corresponding system views, which are in the `SYSVW` schema. All users can access system views; however the rows that are shown to you in a system view are restricted to those row for which you have access.
