Erin,

These directions work on all operating systems; Windows/MAC/Linux for R code.  This process is much simpler for MAC and Linux than configuring linuxODBC or iODBC.





Directions are given using R Studio, but R Studio is not required.

Install R Studio (Optional)
Run update on all packages
Install the following R packages:
RJDBC
rJava
any dependencies required as a result of above
Download the SpliceMachine JDBC jar file
Make note of the location you download and save it to
Example used here:
                                                               i.      MAC:  ~/matt/downloads/splice.jdbc.jar

Determine your JDBC URL to connect to SpliceMachine
Example used here:
                                                               i.      jdbc:splice://192.168.10.1:1527/splicedb

Run the R Snippet code below.
Troubleshooting steps, if R Snippet cannot connect
Install DB Visualizer
Follow directions to install SpliceMachine JDBC Driver
Follow directions to create JDBC URL connect to SpliceMachine
Upon verification DB Visualizer connection works,
                                                               i.      Obtain JDBC URL, username, and password for SpliceMachine





R Snippet code:

library(RJDBC)



vDriver <- JDBC(driverClass="com.splicemachine.db.jdbc.ClientDriver",

                classPath="~/matt/downloads/splice.jdbc.jar")

db      <- dbConnect(vDriver, "jdbc:splice://192.168.10.1:1527/splicedb", "splice", "admin")

sql     <- "select * from SCHEMA.TABLE"

df1     <- dbGetQuery(db, sql)



print (df1)
