Just tried this:
Should this work? Since my user af88888 created the table, should they not be able to insert into it?
Or select from the table?
Basically If I can create a table in this SCHEMA cdl_pims, should I not have all privileges on the table that I just created?
I would not expect all Privileges on the Schema, just the table.

As splice user:
splice> grant modify on schema cdl_pims to af88888;
0 rows inserted/updated/deleted
splice> quit;

[splice@stl-colo-srv136 ~]$ sqlshell.sh -h srv138 -u af88888 -s anthem

-------------------------------------------

Robert Baran No, even though af88888 created the table, it does not have the privilege to insert/select the rows in the table, af88888 is not the owner of the table, it is just being granted the privilege to modify the schema.

To get the full fledge of privileges for tables in a schema, use

grant all privileges on schema schema_name to af88888;

I am fine with whatever the answer is on this. I just want to make sure we
document this correctly in our Docs and I want to be sure that Anthem
understands exactly how it works.
Thank You.
