Gary Hillerson Either you could drop the section on "Converting Out-of-Range Timestamp Values Upon Import" entirely, since splice now supports timestamps from year 1 to year 9999, or you could modify the section to say, something like, "In version 2.7.0.1835 of Splice Machine and prior, the Timestamp data type has a range of 1677-09-21 00:12:43.147 GMT to 2262-04-11 23:47:16.853 GMT...."

If a table was created on a splice version that has extended-range timestamp support, then it will support them, otherwise not.
Here's a way to determine which range of timestamps a table supports:

System tables can be used to look up the table version:

select version from sys.systables, sys.sysschemas where tablename = 'MY_TABLE' and schemaname = 'MY_SCHEMA' and sys.systables.schemaid = sys.sysschemas.schemaid;
VERSION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.0

If the version is 2.0 or below, the table supports the old timestamp range. If it is 3.0 or higher, it supports the full timestamp range, years 1 - 9999.
