You can use the [SYSVW.xxx](sqlref_sysviews_xxx.html) as shown to access the information you need. If you have security clearance to access the [SYS.XXX](sqlref_systables_xxx.html), you'll get better performance from the table; however, access to the `SYS` schema is restricted to Database Administrators and those to whom the Database Administrator has explicitly granted access.

You can determine if you have access to this table by running the following command:

    DESCRIBE XXX

If you see the table description, you have access. If you see a message stating that _"No schema exists with the name `SYS`,"_&nbsp; you don't have access to the table; use the view instead.
