Splice Doc Suggestions:

1) Get rid of generating the PDF version of the docs if no longer required. This was previously required by Anthem. Generating the PDF is an extra build step that works easily enough; however, maintaining it adds work: whenever a new top-level section is added to the docs or the docs are reorganized, some significant script updates are required, and whenever a new style is added, it may need special consideration in the PDF build.

2) Get Brandon or someone to work out automatic builds of the docs whenever a Master branch is updated. This is a well defined path for Jekyll projects that are connected to GitHub.  We would want to consider doc and docstest branches for each version as "masters" in this context.
