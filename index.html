			<h1> Welcome to Splice&#160;Machine!</h1>
			<p>Welcome to Splice Machine, the  database platform for adaptive applications that manage operational processes. This site contains documentation for our products and links to other useful resources.</p>
			<div class="noteIcon">Our new <span class="ItalicFont">Managed Database Service in the Cloud</span> is now available: <a href="dbaas_intro.html">Start Here!</a></div>
			<p>Splice Machine is a hybrid relational database platform that allows you to run transactional (OLTP) and analytical (OLAP)&#160;SQL workloads, concurrently, against shared data. To ensure that one does not interfere with the other, Splice Machine uses resource isolation and a ground-breaking MVCC technology for concurrent, non-locking, distributed ACID transactions. </p>
			<p>With Splice Machine, you can manage operational processes, large-scale IoT infrastructures, and use analytical processing and machine learning to improve over time.</p>
			<p>Splice Machine delivers an open-source data platform that incorporates the proven scalability of HBase™ and the in-memory performance of Apache Spark™. The cost-based optimizer uses advanced statistics to choose the best compute engine, storage engine, index access, join order and join algorithm for each task. In this way, Splice Machine can concurrently process transactional and analytical workloads at scale.</p>
			<h2>Our Products</h2>
			<p>The Splice Machine platform offered in two product versions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can configure and deploy our <a href="dbaas_intro.html">Managed Database Service in the Cloud</a> in a matter of minutes:&#160;simply register, adjust a configuration sliders for your anticipated data size, cluster power, and backup frequency, and you're up and running. A free trial version means that you can get going very quickly and see for yourself how well Splice&#160;Machine can work for your company's needs.</li>
				<li>You can deploy our <a href="onprem_intro.html">On-Premise Database</a> on your own cluster that is managed by Cloudera, MapR, or Hortonworks. We also offer a standalone, trial version that allows you to experiment with Splice Machine on MacOS, Linux, and CentOS computers.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Product Documentation</h2>
			<p>This site includes documentation for both Splice Machine products. The topic sections are organized into three main categories, each of which is represented by a menu at the top of each page.</p>
