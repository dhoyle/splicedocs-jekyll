			<h1> Welcome to Splice&#160;Machine!</h1>
			<p>Welcome to Splice Machine, the  database platform for adaptive applications that manage operational processes. This site contains documentation for our products and links to other useful resources.</p>
			<p>Splice Machine is a hybrid relational database platform that allows you to run transactional (OLTP) and analytical (OLAP)&#160;SQL workloads, concurrently, against shared data. To ensure that one does not interfere with the other, Splice Machine uses resource isolation and a ground-breaking MVCC technology for concurrent, non-locking, distributed ACID transactions. </p>
			<p>With Splice Machine, you can manage operational processes, large-scale IoT infrastructures, and use analytical processing and machine learning to improve over time.</p>
			<p>Splice Machine delivers an open-source data platform that incorporates the proven scalability of HBase™ and the in-memory performance of Apache Spark™. The cost-based optimizer uses advanced statistics to choose the best compute engine, storage engine, index access, join order and join algorithm for each task. In this way, Splice Machine can concurrently process transactional and analytical workloads at scale.</p>
			<h2>Our Products</h2>
