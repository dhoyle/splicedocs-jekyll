        <h1>Using Splice*Plus</h1>
        <p>Splice Machine PL/SQL&#160;extends Splice&#160;Machine SQL&#160;with a procedural language you can use to perform operations that you would otherwise write as SQL&#160;queries. Splice Machine PL/SQL&#160;provides the same functionality as Oracle PL/SQL, with a few notable exceptions, which are detailed in the <a href="#SplicePl">Splice Machine PL/SQL Compared to Oracle PL/SQL</a> section below.</p>
        <p><span class="AppCommand">Splice*Plus</span> is an interactive, command line utility program that provides an interpreter for running PL/SQL&#160;programs interactively. You can run PL/SQL&#160;programs stored in text files, or you can use your keyboard to enter PL/SQL&#160;statements and blocks, similarly to the way you use the <span class="AppCommand">splice&gt;</span>&#160;prompt to run SQL&#160;commands.</p>
        <p class="noteImportant">If you are already familiar with PL/SQL&#160;from using it with Oracle or another database, Splice Machine PL/SQL is almost exactly the same. The PL/SQL topic in this section calls out any differences you need to know about between this implementation of PL/SQL and other implementations.</p>
        <h2>Hello World in PL/SQL</h2>
        <p>Here's a basic PL/SQL&#160;version of "Hello World:"</p>
        <div class="preWrapperWide"><pre class="Example">
DECLARE
   message  varchar2(20):= 'Hello, World!';
BEGIN
   dbms_output.put_line(message);
EXCEPTION
   WHEN PROGRAM_ERROR THEN
      dbms_output.put_line('Uh-oh; something went wrong');
END;
/</pre>
        </div>
        <p class="noteNote">The single <code>/</code> at the end of the program block is required to tell the PL/SQL&#160;interpreter that it should run the code block; if you leave the <code>/</code> out, the interpreter will simply wait for more input after loading the block.</p>
        <h2>Invoking Splice*Plus</h2>
        <p><em>Splice*Plus</em> is automatically installed for you when you install Splice&#160;Machine. To run a PL/SQL&#160;program that you have stored in a text file, invoke <span class="AppCommand">spliceplus</span> and specify on the command line that it should take its input from that file:</p><pre class="ShellCommand">%&#160;spliceplus &lt; helloworld.sql</pre>
        <p>You'll see your code loaded in and executed, and any results will display on your screen. For example:</p>
        <div class="preWrapper"><pre class="ShellCommand">%&#160;spliceplus &lt; helloworld.sql<br />Source file is hellowworld.sql<br />Executing:<br />DECLARE
   message  varchar2(20):= 'Hello, World!';
BEGIN
   dbms_output.put_line(message);<br />EXCEPTION<br /> &#160;&#160;dbms_output.put_line('Uh-oh; something went wrong');
END;<br /><br />Hello, World!<br />%<br /></pre>
        </div>
        <p>To invoke the Splice*Plus interactive environment, open a terminal window and enter the following command line:</p><pre class="ShellCommand">%&#160;spliceplus</pre>
        <p>You'll see </p>
        <div class="preWrapper"><pre class="ShellCommand">%&#160;spliceplus<br />splice*plus&gt;<br /></pre>
        </div>
        <p>You can enter SQL&#160;statements to execute, or you can enter a block of PL/SQL&#160;code. When you want to run PL/SQL&#160;code, simply enter a <code>/</code> on a line by itself, and <span class="AppCommand">splice*plus</span> will execute the block and display the results.</p>
