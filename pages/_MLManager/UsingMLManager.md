# Using the Splice Machine Data Science Workbench

The Splice Machine Data Science Workbench facilitates machine learning development. Here's what the basic flow of processes involved in developing, tuning, and deploying your ML projects looks like with the *MLManager*:

## MLManager Workflow

1. [Obtain your test data](#obtaindata).
2. [Prepare the data](#preparedata).
3. [Select the features you want to use in your model](#selectfeatures).
4. [Choose a learning algorithm to use](#choosealgorithm).
5. [Create and train your model in a Zeppelin notebook](#createmodel).
6. [Iterate, running experiments to refine your model](#runexperiments).
7. [Deploy your model](#deploymodel).
8. [Make ongoing refinements as new data arrives](#ongoing)


### Obtain your test data  {#obtaindata}

### Prepare the data  {#preparedata}

### Select the features you want to use in your model  {#selectfeatures}

### Choose a learning algorithm to use  {#choosealgorithm}

### Create and train your model in a Zeppelin notebook  {#createmodel}

### Iterate, running experiments to refine your model  {#runexperiments}

### Deploy your model  {#deploymodel}

### Make ongoing refinements as new data arrives  {#ongoing}

## How It Works
The components of MLManager work together as follows:
