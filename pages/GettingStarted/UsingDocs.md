# Getting Started with Splice Machine Documentation

This topic helps orient you to the Splice Machine documentation, in
these sections:

* [Splice Machine Layout](#Navigation) explains the layout of our
  documentation web and shows you how to use the various navigation
  tools to land on the pages in which you're interested.
* [Documentation Organization](#ContentDesc) summarizes and links to
  the top-level sections in the Splice Machine documentation
  suite.

## Documentation Layout   {#Navigation}

Here's an image of the top portion of our documentation screen, which is
called the *topbar*:

![](images/topnav.png){: .indentedTightSpacing}

The topbar features these user interface elements:

* Click the *Splice Machine Documentation* title to return you to the
  home page of our documentation.
* Use the *Top Navigation menus* to navigate to the landing page of each main section of the documentation.
* Use the cascading menus in the *Sidebar Navigation* to navigate to specific topics.
* Click the *Navigation Toggle* to toggle the sidebar navigation off or on.
* Start typing your search terms in the *Search Bar* at the top to find relevant topic.

The image below shows how the sidebar looks when you're viewing this page, *Using Our Documentation.* Note that the current topic is highlighted, and the name of the *section* to which the topic belongs is drawn in a different color:

A few notes of interest regarding the sidebar:


* Whenever you navigate to a new topic, the sidebar will automatically highlight the location of your current page in the navigation hierachy.

* The name of the currently expanded section is shown with a down-facing triangle:

  ![](images/sidebardownarrow.png){: .indentedTiny}

* The name of any section that can be expanded to reveal topics is shown with a right-facing triangle:

  ![](images/sidebarrightarrow.png){: .indentedTiny}

* Links that include a boxed arrow symbol are *external links* that open in a separate browser tab or window:

### Internal and External Links

Links to other pages in the documenation are shown in underlined blue.

Links to external sites are also shown in underlined blue, and include a boxed arrow symbol that indicates the link will automatically open in a separate browser tab or window. This is also true in the sidebar:



## Documentation Organization  {#ContentDesc}

This site includes documentation for both of our Splice Machine
products and two ways to navigate. Most of the topics apply to all of our products; any product-specific topics are gathered into their own top-level (chapter) sections. Here are the main sections of the Splice Machine documentation:
