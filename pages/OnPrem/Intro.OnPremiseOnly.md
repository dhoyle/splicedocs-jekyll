Splice Machine delivers an open-source data platform that incorporates
the proven scalability of HBase and the in-memory performance of Apache
Spark. The cost-based optimizer uses advanced statistics to choose the
best compute engine, storage engine, index access, join order and join
algorithm for each task. In this way, Splice Machine can concurrently
process transactional and analytical workloads at scale.

You can deploy the Splice Machine *On-Premise Database* on a standalone
computer or on your own cluster that is managed by Cloudera, MapR, or
Hortonworks. We offer Enterprise, Cluster Community, and Standalone
Community editions. You can also access the open source code for our
community editions on GitHub.
