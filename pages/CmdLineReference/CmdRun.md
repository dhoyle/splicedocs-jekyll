# Run Command

The <span class="AppCommand">run</span> command redirects the command
line interpreter to read and process commands from the specified file.
This continues until the end of the file is reached, or an
[exit](cmdlineref_exit.html) command is executed. Note that the file
*can* contain `run` commands.

You can specify a file that is in the directory where you are running
the command, or you can include the full file path so that the `run`
command can find it.
{: .noteNote}

The command line interpreter prints out the statements in the file as it
executes them.
