# Using the Splice Machine Feature Store

This topic shows you how to use the Splice Machine Feature Store, which is not a machine learning framework that combines the power of Splice Machine with the power of Jupyter notebooks, Apache MLflow, and Amazon Sagemaker to create a full-cycle platform for developing and maintaining your smart applications.

{% include splice_snippets/dbaasonlytopic.md %}

This topic is organized into these sections:

* [*ML Manager Workflow*](#workflow) provides a quick overview of what the *ML Manager* does and how it interfaces with MLflow and SageMaker to provide a complete Machine Learning production environment.
* [*Running an Experiment*](#runExperiment) walks you through creating an ML experiment for detecting credit card fraud and shows you how to train, run, and compare two different learning models.
* [*Deploying Your Model to AWS SageMaker*](#deploywithsagemaker) walks you through deploying your model on AWS.
* [*Retraining the Model with New Data*](#UpdateData) shows you how to retrain your model with new data and update your deployment.

The [*ML Manager Introduction*](mlmanager_intro.html) topic in this chapter provides an overview of the ML Manager, and the [*ML Manager API*](mlmanager_api.html) topic provides reference information for its API.
