# Using the Splice Machine Feature Store

This topic shows you how to use the Splice Machine Feature Store, which is not a machine learning framework that combines the power of Splice Machine with the power of Jupyter notebooks, Apache MLflow, and Amazon Sagemaker to create a full-cycle platform for developing and maintaining your smart applications.

{% include splice_snippets/dbaasonlytopic.md %}

This topic is organized into these sections:

* [*ML Manager Workflow*](#workflow) provides a quick overview of what the *ML Manager* does and how it interfaces with MLflow and SageMaker to provide a complete Machine Learning production environment.
* [*Running an Experiment*](#runExperiment) walks you through creating an ML experiment for detecting credit card fraud and shows you how to train, run, and compare two different learning models.
* [*Deploying Your Model to AWS SageMaker*](#deploywithsagemaker) walks you through deploying your model on AWS.
* [*Retraining the Model with New Data*](#UpdateData) shows you how to retrain your model with new data and update your deployment.

The [*ML Manager Introduction*](mlmanager_intro.html) topic in this chapter provides an overview of the ML Manager, and the [*ML Manager API*](mlmanager_api.html) topic provides reference information for its API.

## *ML Manager* WorkFlow  {#workflow}

Here's what the basic flow of processes involved in developing, tuning, and deploying your ML projects looks like with *ML Manager* and our cloud-based Database-as-Service product:

<img class='indentedTightSpacing' src='images/DSFlow3.png'>

The basic workflow is:
<div class="opsStepsList" markdown="1">
1. Work with MLlib and other machine learning libraries in a Jupyter notebook to directly interact with Spark and your Splice Machine database.
2. Use MLflow within your notebook to create *experiments* and *runs*, and to track variables, parameters, and other information about your runs.
3. Use the MLflow Tracking UI to monitor information about your experiments and runs.
4. Iterate on your experiments until you develop the learning model that you want to deploy, using the tracking UI to compare your runs.
5. Use the Splice ML Jobs Tracker to deploy your model to AWS SageMaker, by simply filling in a few form fields and clicking a button.
6. Write Apps that use SageMaker's RESTful API to interface with your deployed model.
7. As new data arrives, you can return to Step 1 and repeat the process.

### About MLflow

MLflow is an open source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle; with MLflow and Splice ML Manager, you can:

* Track your model training sessions, which are called *runs*.
* Group a collection of runs under an *experiment*, which allows you to visualize and compare a set of runs, and to download run artifacts for analysis by other tools.
* View your experiments in the *MLflow Tracking UI*, which you access by pointing your browser at port `5001`.

### About Storing Models and Pipelines

You can save your pipeline and model to S3 using the `save` method of MLlib `Pipeline` or MLlib `model` objects. Assuming that you've created a pipeline and built a model, you can save them as follows:

```
%spark.pyspark
model.save('s3a://splice-demo/fraudDemoPipelineModel')
```
{: .Example}

or

```
%spark.pyspark
pipeline.save('s3a://splice-demo/fraudDemoPipeline')
```
{: .Example}


If you are developing or have developed a model that you expect to deploy in the future, you should save the model to MLflow. Assuming that you've previously created an instance of `MLManager` named `manager` and have created a MLlib model named `model`, you can save the model to MLflow with this statement:
{: .spaceAbove}

```
%spark.pyspark
manager.log_spark_model(model)
```
{: .Example}

The code in the [*Running an Experiment*](#runExperiment) section below contains examples of saving models to S3 and to MLflow.
{: .spaceAbove}

### About SageMaker

Amazon Sagemaker allows you to easily deploy the machine learning models that you develop with the *Splice ML Manager* on Amazon AWS. The only requirement is that you have an *ECR* repository set up on AWS; ECR is Amazon's fully-managed Docker contrainer registry that simplifies deploying Docker images and is integrated with Amazon's Elastic Container Service (ECS).

When you tell our *ML Manager* to deploy a model to SageMaker, *ML Manager* creates a Docker image and uploads it to your ECR repository. You can specify which AWS instance types you want to deploy on, and how many instances you want to deploy. We send the deployment request to SageMaker, which creates an endpoint, launches your ML compute instances, and the deploys your model to them.

You can also use the same process to deploy an updated version of your model.

## Running an Experiment  {#runExperiment}

This section walks you through creating and running an experiment with ML Manager, in these steps:

* [Preparing Your Experiment](#prepareExperiment)
* [The First Run](#runFirst)
* [Trying a Different Model](#trydifferentmodel)

The Splice ML Manager, along with MLflow, allows you to group a set of *runs* into an *experiment*. Each run can use different values and parameters, all of which can be easily tracked and evaluated with help from the MLflow user interface.

The default cell type in our Jupyter environment is a code cell that runs Python.
{: .noteNote}

### Preparing Your Experiment  {#prepareExperiment}
In this section, we'll prepare our first experiment, in these steps:

1. [Load the data into your database](#loadtodb)
2. [Run a few simple queries](#query)
3. [Establish a Connection to Your Database](#connect)
4. [Create your `MLManager` instance](#createmlmgr)
5. [Create a new experiment](##createexperiment)
6. [Review your data](#review)


#### 1. Load the Data into your database  {#loadtodb}

First we'll create the table in our Splice Machine database for our fraud data:

```
%%sql

create schema cc_fraud;
set schema cc_fraud;

drop table if exists cc_fraud_data;

create table cc_fraud.cc_fraud_data (
    time_offset integer,
    v1 double,
    v2 double,
    v3 double,
    v4 double,
    v5 double,
    v6 double,
    v7 double,
    v8 double,
    v9 double,
    v10 double,
    v11 double,
    v12 double,
    v13 double,
    v14 double,
    v15 double,
    v16 double,
    v17 double,
    v18 double,
    v19 double,
    v20 double,
    v21 double,
    v22 double,
    v23 double,
    v24 double,
    v25 double,
    v26 double,
    v27 double,
    v28 double,
    amount decimal(10,2),
    class_result int
);
```
{: .Example}

And then we import the data from S3 into the table:
{: .spaceAbove}

```
%%sql

call SYSCS_UTIL.IMPORT_DATA (
     'cc_fraud',
     'cc_fraud_data',
     null,
     's3a://splice-demo/kaggle-fraud-data/creditcard.csv',
     ',',
     null,
     null,
     null,
     null,
     -1,
     's3a://splice-demo/kaggle-fraud-data/bad',
     null,
     null);
```
{: .Example}


#### 2. Run a few simple queries against the new data:  {#query}

You can query the data to verify that everything was loaded properly:

```
%%sql
select top 10 * from cc_fraud.cc_fraud_data
```
{: .Example}
```
%%sql
select class_result, count(*) from cc_fraud.cc_fraud_data group by class_result
```
{: .Example}
```
%%sql
explain select class_result, count(*) from cc_fraud.cc_fraud_data group by class_result
```
{: .Example}

#### 3. Establish a Connection to Your Database  {#connect}

Now we'll create a connection to your database using Python, via our Native Spark DataSource:

```
from splicemachine.spark.context import PySpliceContext
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
# Create our Spark Session
spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()
sc = spark.sparkContext
# Create our Native Database Connection
splice = PySpliceContext(spark)
```
{: .Example}

#### 4. Create your MLManager Instance  {#createmlmgr}

To use ML Manager, you need to first create a class instance; creating the MLManager object returns a tracking URL.

There is exactly one tracking URL *per cluster*, which means that if you create another MLManager object in another notebook, it will return the same tracking URL. This means that you can create multiple experiments in multiple notebooks, and and all of them will be tracked in the MLFlow UI.

```
from splicemachine.ml.management import MLManager
manager = MLManager(splice)
```
{: .Example}

```
from splicemachine.ml.management import MLManager
manager = MLManager()
```
{: .Example}

You should see a message similar to this:

```
Tracking Model Metadata on MLFlow Server @ http://mlflow:5001
```
{: .Example}

#### 5. Create an Experiment  {#createexperiment}

Now we'll create an MLflow experiment named `fraud_demo` and load our data into a DataFrame:

```
#create our MLFlow experiment
manager.create_experiment('fraud_demo')
df = splice.df("SELECT * FROM cc_fraud.cc_fraud_data")
df = df.withColumnRenamed('CLASS_RESULT', 'label')
display(df.limit(10).toPandas())
```
{: .Example}

You can now view your new experiment in the MLflow Tracking UI, at port `5001`:

<img class='indentedTightSpacing' src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/splice-demo/mlflow_UI_fraud.png'>

#### 6. Review your data  {#review}

It's a good idea to review your data before going any further. Specifically, you should look at the correlations between your features each other and the label. We'll create a heatmap for this purpose:

```
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

for i in df.columns:
    df = df.withColumn(i,df[i].cast(FloatType()))

pdf = df.limit(5000).toPandas()
correlations = pdf.corr()
correlations.style.set_precision(2)

plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = (8,12)
plt.matshow(correlations, cmap='coolwarm')

ticks = [i for i in range(len(correlations.columns))]
plt.xticks(ticks, correlations.columns)
plt.yticks(ticks, correlations.columns)


plt.title('Fraud Data correlation heatmap')
plt.show()
```
{: .Example}

Here's the result:

<img class='indentedTightSpacing' src='images/heatmap.png'>

### Running Your First Experiment  {#runfirst}

Now that we're set up, let's create a run named `Ben` and run our experiment, using the logging functionality of `MLManager` to record and track the attributes of our run.

We'll use these steps to run our experiment:
1. [Set up and start a run](#createrun)
2. [Create a Pipeline](#createpipeline)
4. [Set up the Model](#trainandrun)
5. [Run the Cross Validator](#runcross)
6. [Train the Model](#trainmodel)
7. [Save the Model](#savemodel)

#### 1. Set up and start a run  {#createrun}

Using our MLManager object, we'll first configure tags for our experiment; you can attach whatever tags you like to an experiment. Note that your `user_id` tag (the ID used to log into the notebook) is automatically added.

```
    #start our first MLFlow run
tags = {
        'team': 'MyCompany',
        'purpose': 'fraud r&d',
        'attempt-date': '12/31/2019',
        'attempt-number': '1'
       }
manager.start_run(tags=tags)
```
{: .Example}

##### Model Considerations

Since our data contains a limited number of fraudulent examples, we decide to expand that number for training purposes. To achieve this, we oversample fraudulent transactions and undersample non-fraudulent ones. We need to make sure the model isn't overfit and doesn't always predict non-fraud (due to the lack of fraud data), so we can't only rely on accuracy. Our goal is to pick a model that does not have a high over-fitting rate.

#### 3. Create a Pipeline  {#createpipeline}
Now we can create a Pipeline to normalize our continuous features. We can use Spark's `Pipeline` class to define a set of Transformers that set up your dataset for modeling.

We'll use the `StandardScaler`, which standardizes features by scaling to unit variance and/or removing the mean using, column summary statistics on the samples in the training set. And we'll create our feature vector with the `VectorAssembler` transformer, which combines a given list of columns into a single vector column.

Finally, we'll use `MLManager` to `log` our Pipeline stages.

```
from pyspark.ml.feature import StandardScaler, VectorAssembler
from pyspark.ml import Pipeline,PipelineModel
from pyspark.ml.classification import RandomForestClassifier, MultilayerPerceptronClassifier

feature_cols = df.columns[:-1]
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol='features')
scaler = StandardScaler(inputCol="features", outputCol='scaledFeatures')
rf = RandomForestClassifier()

stages = [assembler,scaler,rf]
mlpipe = Pipeline(stages=stages)
manager.log_pipeline_stages(mlpipe)
```
{: .Example}

#### 4. Train and Run the Model   {#trainandrun}

Now we can set up our modeling process; we'll use `OverSampleCrossValidator` to properly oversample our dataset for model building. And we'll add a few lines of code to track all of our moves in MLFlow:

```
from utils1 import OverSampleCrossValidator as OSCV
from pyspark.ml.tuning import ParamGridBuilder
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import BinaryClassificationEvaluator,MulticlassClassificationEvaluator
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Define evaluation metrics
PRevaluator = BinaryClassificationEvaluator(metricName = 'areaUnderPR') # Because this is a needle in haystack problem
AUCevaluator = BinaryClassificationEvaluator(metricName = 'areaUnderROC')
ACCevaluator = MulticlassClassificationEvaluator(metricName="accuracy")
f1evaluator = MulticlassClassificationEvaluator(metricName="f1")

# Define hyperparameters to try
params = {rf.maxDepth: [5,15], \
          rf.numTrees: [10,30], \
          rf.minInfoGain: [0.0,2.0]}

paramGrid_stages = ParamGridBuilder()
for param in params:
    paramGrid_stages.addGrid(param,params[param])
paramGrid = paramGrid_stages.build()

# Create the CrossValidator
fraud_cv = OSCV(estimator=mlpipe,
                        estimatorParamMaps=paramGrid,
                        evaluator=PRevaluator,
                        numFolds=3,
                        label = 'label',
                        seed = 1234,
                        parallelism = 3,
                        altEvaluators = [ACCevaluator, f1evaluator, AUCevaluator])
```
{: .Example}

#### 5. Run the Cross Validator  {#runcross}

Now we can run the `CrossValidator` and log the results to MLFlow:

```
df = df.withColumnRenamed('Amount', 'label')
manager.start_timer('with_oversample')
fraud_cv_model, alt_metrics = fraud_cv.fit(df)
execution_time = manager.log_and_stop_timer()

print(f"--- {execution_time} seconds == {execution_time/60} minutes == {execution_time/60/60} hours")


# Grab metrics of best model
best_avg_prauc = max(mycvModel.avgMetrics)
best_performing_model = np.argmax(fraud_cv_model.avgMetrics)

# metrics at the best performing model for this iteration
best_avg_acc = [alt_metrics[i][0] for i in range(len(alt_metrics))][best_performing_model]
best_avg_f1 = [alt_metrics[i][1] for i in range(len(alt_metrics))][best_performing_model]
best_avg_rocauc = [alt_metrics[i][2] for i in range(len(alt_metrics))][best_performing_model]

print(f"The Best average (Area under PR) for this grid search: {best_avg_prauc}")
print(f"The Best average (Accuracy) for this grid search: {best_avg_acc}")
print(f"The Best average (F1) for this grid search: {best_avg_f1}")
print(f"The Best average (Area under ROC) for this grid search: {best_avg_rocauc}")

evals = [('areaUnderPR',best_avg_prauc), ('Accuracy',best_avg_acc),('F1',best_avg_f1),('areaUnderROC',best_avg_rocauc)]
manager.log_metrics(evals)

# Get the best parameters
bestParamsCombination = {}
for stage in fraud_cv_model.bestModel.stages:
    bestParams = stage.extractParamMap()
    for param in params:
        if param in bestParams:
            bestParamsCombination[param] = bestParams[param]

#log the hyperparams
manager.log_params(list(bestParamsCombination.items()))

print("Best Param Combination according to f1 is: \n")
print(pd.DataFrame([(str(i.name),str(bestParamsCombination[i]))for i in bestParamsCombination], columns = ['Param','Value']))

# Feature importance of the Principal comp
importances = fraud_cv_model.bestModel.stages[-1].featureImportances.toArray()
top_5_idx = np.argsort(importances)[-5:]
top_5_values = [importances[i] for i in top_5_idx]

top_5_features = [new_features[i] for i in top_5_idx]
print("___________________________________")
importances = fraud_cv_model.bestModel.stages[-1].featureImportances.toArray()

print("Most Important Features are")
print(pd.DataFrame(zip(top_5_features,top_5_values), columns = ['Feature','Importance']).sort_values('Importance',ascending=False))


#Log feature importances
manager.log_params()
```
{: .Example}

#### 6. Run the Model  {#runmodel}
We have a model that looks fairly accurate; however, we trained this model on balanced data, so we need to verify that it can be generalized to work with unbalanced data:

```
%spark.pyspark
#pull in full dataset
new_df = splice.df('select * from cc_fraud.cc_fraud_data')
new_df = new_df.withColumnRenamed('CLASS_RESULT', 'label')

#transform and run model on new dataframe
new_predictions = model.transform(new_df)

new_eval = SpliceBinaryClassificationEvaluator(spark)
new_eval.input(new_predictions)
z.show(new_eval.get_results())
```
{: .Example}

#### 6. Train the Model  {#trainmodel}

Now we can train our model:

```
import random
from utils1 import overSampler
from splicemachine.ml.utilities import SpliceBinaryClassificationEvaluator
rf_depth = [5,10,20,30]
rf_trees = [8,12,18,26]
rf_subsampling_rate = [1.0,0.9,0.8]
oversample_rate = [0.4,0.7,1.0]

for i in range(1,5):
    tags = {
        'team': 'MyCompany',
        'purpose': 'fraud r&d',
        'attempt-date': '11/07/2019',
        'attempt-number': 'f{i}'
       }
    manager.start_run(tags=tags)

    #random variable choice
    depth = random.choice(rf_depth)
    trees = random.choice(rf_trees)
    subsamp_rate = random.choice(rf_subsampling_rate)
    ovrsmpl_rate = random.choice(oversample_rate)

    #transformers
    feature_cols = df.columns[:-1]
    ovr = overSampler(label='label',ratio = ovrsmpl_rate, majorityLabel = 0, minorityLabel = 1, withReplacement = False)
    assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol='features')
    scaler = StandardScaler(inputCol="features", outputCol='scaledFeatures')
    rf = RandomForestClassifier(maxDepth=depth, numTrees=trees, subsamplingRate=subsamp_rate)

    #pipeline
    stages = [ovr,assembler,scaler,rf]
    mlpipe = Pipeline(stages=stages)
    #log the stages of the pipeline
    manager.log_pipeline_stages(mlpipe)
    #log what happens to each feature
    manager.log_feature_transformations(mlpipe)

    #run on the data
    train, test = df.randomSplit([0.8,0.2])
    manager.start_timer(f'CV iteration {i}')
    trainedModel = mlpipe.fit(train)
    execution_time = manager.log_and_stop_timer()
    print(f"--- {execution_time} seconds == {execution_time/60} minutes == {execution_time/60/60} hours")

    #log model parameters
    manager.log_model_params(trainedModel)
    preds = trainedModel.transform(test)
    #evaluate
    evaluator = SpliceBinaryClassificationEvaluator()
    evaluator.input(preds)
    metrics = evaluator.get_results(dict=True)
    #log model performance
    manager.log_metrics(list(metrics.items()))
```
{: .Example}


#### 7. Save the Model  {#savemodel}

We want to be able to retrain our model when new data arrives, so we'll save the pipeline and model to an S3 bucket. And since we're planning to deploy this model, we'll also save it to MLflow:

```
#save the pipeline and model to s3
model.save('s3a://splice-demo/fraudDemoPipelineModel')
#save model to MLflow for deployment
manager.log_spark_model(model)
```
{: .Example}



## Deploying the Model with SageMaker  {#deploywithsagemaker}

Once you've run an experiment run that looks good, you can interface with Amazon SageMaker to deploy your model on AWS, following these steps:

1. [Create an ECR Repository for your Experiment](#createEcr).
2. [Find your Experiment and Run IDs](#findIds)
3. [Deploy Your Model](#deploy)


### Step 1: Create an ECR Repository  {#createEcr}

Elastic Container Registry (*ECR*) is Amazon's managed AWS Docker registry service; it supports private Docker repositories with resource-based permissions using AWS IAM so that specific users or Amazon EC2 instances can access repositories and images.

When you tell the *Splice ML Manager* to deploy your model to SageMaker, *ML Manager* creates a Docker image, saves it to your ECR repo, and tells AWS to deploy it for you. You then have an endpoint on AWS with a RESTfull API that your apps can use to interact with your model.

To take advantage of this capability, you need to create a repository on ECR. See the [Amazon ECR documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/get-set-up-for-amazon-ecr.html){: target="_blank"} for information about creating your repository.


### Step 2: Find your Experiment and Run IDs  {#findIds}
Before deploying your model, you need to have the IDs of the experiment and run that you want to deploy; you can find both of these in the *MLflow Tracking UI*. Follow these steps:

<div class="opsStepsList" markdown="1">
1. Navigate to port 5001 in your web browser to display the MLflow Tracking UI. For example: `https://myacct-machine.splicemachine.io:5001/#/`.

2. Select the experiment that you want to deploy. In this example, we've selected the experiment named `test_exp`:
   <img src="images/MlflowTrackingUI1.png" class="indentedTightSpacing" class="indentedTightSpacing">

3. Record the Experiment ID displayed for the experiment; in the above example, we're viewing Experiment ID `1`.

4. Select the ID of the run that you want to deploy; here we've selected the topmost (most recent) run of Experiment `1`. When you click this Run ID, you'll see its details displayed:
   <img src="images/MlflowTrackingUI2.png" class="indentedTightSpacing">

5. Copy the `Run ID` value to your clipboard.
</div>

### Step 3: Deploy Your Model  {#deploy}
Once you know your Experiment and Run ID values, you can use the Splice ML Jobs Tracker to deploy your model. Follow these steps:

<div class="opsStepsList" markdown="1">
1. Navigate to port 5003 in your web browser to display the *ML Manager* Jobs Tracker. For example:<br />
`https://myacct-machine.splicemachine.io:5003/#/`
2. Click the <span class="ConsoleLink">deploy</span> link at the top of the screen to display the deploy form:
   <img src="images/MlJobDeploy1.png" class="indentedTightSpacing">
3. Fill in the form fields:
   <table>
       <col />
       <col />
       <thead>
           <tr>
               <th>Field</th>

       <tbody>
           <tr>
               <td><em>Run UUID</em></td>
               <td>The Run ID that you copied to your clipboard from the MLflow Tracking UI.</td>

           <tr>
               <td><em>Experiment ID</em></td>

                                <td>Create a new deployment.</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td><em>Replace</em></td>
                                <td>Replace an existing deployment.</td>

## Retraining the Model with New Data {#UpdateData}

Whenever additional labeled data arrives, we can pull either or both of our models from S3 and run the new data through it, allowing us to easily enhance accuracy over time.

```
#load the fraud data from splicemachine
new_data = splice.df('select * from cc_fraud.cc_fraud_data2')
#load NN model from s3
mod = PipelineModel.load('s3a://splice-demo/fraudDemoPipelineModel')
new_data = new_data.withColumnRenamed('CLASS_RESULT', 'label')

print('running model...')
preds = mod.transform(new_data)
eval = SpliceBinaryClassificationEvaluator(spark)
eval.input(preds)
z.show(eval.get_results())
```
{: .Example}

### Redeploying the Model

To redeploy your model after retraining, you can use the same steps you used when originally deploying it, as described in [Deploy Your Model](#deploy), above. Simply select *Replace* as your deployment mode, and your model will be redeployed.
