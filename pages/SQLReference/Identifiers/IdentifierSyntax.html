            <h1 id="kanchor404">SQL&#160;Identifier Syntax</h1>
            <p>An SQLIdentifier is a dictionary object identifier that conforms to the rules of ANSI&#160;SQL; identifiers for dictionary objects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>are limited to 128 characters </li>
                <li>are automatically translated into uppercase by the system, making them case-insensitive unless delimited by double quotes</li>
                <li>cannot be a&#160;<a href="sqlref_sqlreserved.html">Splice Machine SQL&#160;keyword</a> unless delimited by double quotes</li>
                <li>can sometimes be qualified by a schema, table, or correlation name, as described below</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Examples:</h3>
            <p>This view name:</p>
            <div class="preWrapperWide"><pre class="Example" xml:space="preserve">CREATE VIEW PitchingCoaches(RECEIVED) AS VALUES 1;
</pre>
            </div>
            <p>is stored in system catalogs as <span class="CodeFont">PITCHINGCOACHES</span>, since it is not quoted. </p>
            <p>Whereas this view name:</p>
            <div class="preWrapperWide"><pre class="Example" xml:space="preserve">CREATE VIEW "PitchingCoaches"(RECEIVED) AS VALUES 1;
</pre>
            </div>
            <p>is quoted, and thus is stored as <span class="CodeFont">PitchingCoaches</span> in the system catalog</p>
            <h2>Qualifying dictionary objects</h2>
            <p>Since some dictionary objects can be contained within other objects, you can qualify those dictionary object names. Each component is separated from the next by a period (<span class="CodeFont">.</span>). You qualify a dictionary object name in order to avoid ambiguity.</p>
            <h3>Examples:</h3>
            <p>Here is an example of a simple, unqualified SQLIdentifier used to name a table:</p>
            <div class="preWrapperWide"><pre class="Example" xml:space="preserve">CREATE&#160;TABLE&#160;Coaches(&#160;ID&#160;INT&#160;NOT&#160;NULL );</pre>
            </div>
            <p>And here's an example of a table name (<span class="CodeFont">Coaches</span>)&#160;qualified by a schema name (<span class="CodeFont">Baseball</span>):</p>
            <div class="preWrapperWide"><pre class="Example" xml:space="preserve">CREATE&#160;TABLE&#160;Baseball.Coaches(&#160;ID&#160;INT&#160;NOT&#160;NULL );
</pre>
            </div>
            <h2 id="SQL92Rules">Rules for SQL Identifiers</h2>
            <p class="body">Here are some additional rules that apply to SQLIdentifiers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Ordinary identifiers are identifiers not surrounded by double quotation marks:</p>
                    <ul class="bullet">
                        <li>An ordinary identifier must begin with a letter and contain only letters, underscore characters (<span class="CodeFont">_</span>), and digits.</li>
                        <li>All Unicode letters and digits are permitted; however, Splice Machine does not attempt to ensure that the characters in identifiers are valid in the database's locale.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Delimited identifiers are identifiers surrounded by double quotation marks:</p>
                    <ul class="bullet">
                        <li>A delimited identifier can contain any characters within the double quotation marks.</li>
                        <li> The enclosing double quotation marks are not part of the identifier; they serve only to mark its beginning and end.</li>
                        <li>Spaces at the end of a delimited identifier are truncated.</li>
                        <li>You can use two consecutive double quotation marks within a delimited identifier to include a double quotation mark within the identifier.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="kanchor405">Capitalization and Special Characters in SQL Statements</h2>
            <p>You can submit SQL&#160;statements to Splice Machine as strings by using JDBC; these strings use the Unicode character set. Within these strings:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Double quotation marks delimit special identifiers referred to in ANSI&#160;SQL as <span class="ItalicFont">delimited identifiers</span>. </li>
                <li>Single quotation marks delimit character strings.</li>
                <li>Within a character string, to represent a single quotation mark or apostrophe, use two single quotation marks. (In other words, a single quotation mark is the escape character for a single quotation mark).
				</li>
                <li>SQL keywords are case-insensitive. For example, you can type the keyword
<span class="CodeFont">SELECT</span> as <span class="CodeFont">SELECT</span>, <span class="CodeFont">Select</span>, <span class="CodeFont">select</span>, or <span class="CodeFont">sELECT</span>.</li>
                <li>ANSI&#160;SQL -style identifiers are case-insensitive unless they are delimited.</li>
                <li>Java-style identifiers are always case-sensitive.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Other Special Characters:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="CodeFont">*</span> is a wildcard within a <span class="ItalicFont"><a href="sqlref_expressions_select.html#StarWildcard">Select Expression</a></span>. It
can also be the multiplication operator. In all other cases, it is a syntactical
metasymbol that flags items you can repeat 0 or more times.</li>
                <li><span class="CodeFont">%</span> and <span class="CodeFont">_</span> are character wildcards when used within character strings following
a <span class="CodeFont">LIKE</span> operator (except when escaped with an escape character). See <a href="sqlref_expressions_boolean.html">Boolean expressions</a>.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>Comments can be either single-line or multi-line, as per the ANSI&#160;SQL standard:</p>
                    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                        <li>Single line
comments start with two dashes (<span class="CodeFont">--</span>) and end with the newline character. </li>
                        <li>Multi-line
comments are bracketed and start with forward slash star (<span class="CodeFont">/*</span>), and end with star
forward slash (<span class="CodeFont">*/</span>). Note that bracketed comments may be nested. Any text between
the starting and ending comment character sequence is ignored.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
