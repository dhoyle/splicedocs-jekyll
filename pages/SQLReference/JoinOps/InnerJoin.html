            <h1 id="SQL-JoinOps.InnerJoin">INNER JOIN</h1>
            <p>An <code>INNER JOIN</code> is a <a href="sqlref_joinops_about.html"><code>JOIN</code> operation</a> that allows you to specify an explicit join clause. </p>
            <h2>Syntax</h2>
            <div class="fcnWrapperWide"><pre class="FcnSyntax" xml:space="preserve"><a href="sqlref_expressions_table.html">TableExpression</a>
  {ON <em>booleanExpression</em> | <em><a href="sqlref_clauses_using.html">USING clause</a></em>}</pre>
            </div>
            <p>You can specify the join clause by specifying <code>ON</code>
with a boolean expression.  </p>
            <p>The scope of expressions in the <code>ON</code> clause includes the current tables and any tables in outer query blocks to the current <code>SELECT</code>. In the following example, the <code>ON</code> clause refers to the current tables:</p>
            <div class="preWrapper"><pre class="Example" xml:space="preserve">SELECT *
  FROM SAMP.EMPLOYEE INNER JOIN SAMP.STAFF
  ON EMPLOYEE.SALARY &lt; STAFF.SALARY;</pre>
            </div>
            <p>The <code>ON</code> clause can reference tables not being joined
and does not have to reference either of the tables being joined (though typically it does). </p>
            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <div class="preWrapperWide"><pre class="Example" xml:space="preserve">   -- Join the EMP_ACT and EMPLOYEE tables
   -- select all the columns from the EMP_ACT table and
   -- add the employee's surname (LASTNAME) from the EMPLOYEE table
   -- to each row of the result
splice&gt;&#160;SELECT SAMP.EMP_ACT.*, LASTNAME
  FROM SAMP.EMP_ACT JOIN SAMP.EMPLOYEE
  ON EMP_ACT.EMPNO = EMPLOYEE.EMPNO;

   -- Join the EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT tables,
   -- select the employee number (EMPNO),
   -- employee surname (LASTNAME),
   -- department number (WORKDEPT in the EMPLOYEE table and DEPTNO in the
   -- DEPARTMENT table)
   -- and department name (DEPTNAME)
   -- of all employees who were born (BIRTHDATE) earlier than 1930.
splice&gt;&#160;SELECT EMPNO, LASTNAME, WORKDEPT, DEPTNAME
  FROM SAMP.EMPLOYEE JOIN SAMP.DEPARTMENT
  ON WORKDEPT = DEPTNO
  AND YEAR(BIRTHDATE) &lt; 1930;

   -- Another example of "generating" new data values,
   -- using a query which selects from a VALUES clause (which is an
   -- alternate form of a fullselect).
   -- This query shows how a table can be derived called "X"
   -- having 2 columns "R1" and "R2" and 1 row of data
splice&gt;&#160;SELECT *
  FROM (VALUES (3, 4), (1, 5), (2, 6))
  AS VALUESTABLE1(C1, C2)
  JOIN (VALUES (3, 2), (1, 2),
  (0, 3)) AS VALUESTABLE2(c1, c2)
  ON VALUESTABLE1.c1 = VALUESTABLE2.c1;
   -- This results in:
   -- C1         |C2         |C1         |2
   -- -----------------------------------------------
   -- 3          |4          |3          |2
   -- 1          |5          |1          |2

  ON MGRNO = EMPNO;

   -- List every employee number and last name
   -- with the employee number and last name of their manager
splice&gt;&#160;SELECT E.EMPNO, E.LASTNAME, M.EMPNO, M.LASTNAME
  FROM EMPLOYEE E INNER JOIN
