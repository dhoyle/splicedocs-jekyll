# FULL JOIN

A `FULL JOIN` is a &nbsp; [`JOIN` operation](sqlref_joinops_about.html) that
allows you to combine the rows from two tables, including the rows in either table that don't have match in the other table.

A *FULL JOIN* can also be referred to as a *FULL OUTER JOIN*.

## Syntax

<div class="fcnWrapperWide"><pre class="FcnSyntax">
<a href="sqlref_expressions_table.html">TableExpression</a>
  { ON booleanExpression | <a href="sqlref_clauses_using.html">USING clause</a> }</pre>

</div>
You can specify the join clause by specifying `ON` with a Boolean
expression.

The scope of expressions in the `ON` clause includes the current tables
and any tables in outer query blocks to the current `SELECT`. In the
following example, the `ON` clause refers to the current tables:

<div class="preWrapper" markdown="1">
    SELECT *
      FROM SAMP.EMPLOYEE FULL JOIN SAMP.STAFF
      ON EMPLOYEE.SALARY < STAFF.SALARY;
{: .Example xml:space="preserve"}

</div>
The `ON` clause can reference tables not being joined and does not have
to reference either of the tables being joined (though typically it
does).
