# System Views

This section contains the reference documentation for the Splice Machine
System Views.

<div class="noteIcon" markdown="1">
System views return a subset of the rows in their corresponding system tables: the rows in a view are limited to the schemas that are visible to the current user. This means that which rows are in a system view varies from user to user.

These schemas are visible to the current user:

* Schemas owned by the current user
* Schemas to which the current user belongs
* Schemas to which user groups in which the current user is a member belongs
* Schemas to which roles granted directly or indirectly to the current user have acess

The database administrator has access to all schemas, and thus all rows in the system tables.

</div>

Since the system views belong to the `SYSVW`Â schema, you must preface any
inquiries involving these views with the `SYSVW.` prefix.

The following table lists the System Views:
