            <h1>Welcome to the Splice Machine Database Service!</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Splice Machine, the  database platform for adaptive applications that manage operational processes. This site contains documentation for our <span class="ConsoleLink">Managed Database Service in the Cloud</span>.</p>

            <p>Splice Machine is a hybrid relational database platform that allows you to run transactional (OLTP) and analytical (OLAP)&#160;SQL workloads, concurrently, against shared data. To ensure that one does not interfere with the other, Splice Machine uses resource isolation and a ground-breaking MVCC technology for concurrent, non-locking, distributed ACID transactions. </p>
            <p>With Splice Machine, you can manage operational processes, large-scale IoT infrastructures, and use analytical processing and machine learning to improve over time.</p>
            <p>Splice Machine delivers an open-source data platform that incorporates the proven scalability of HBase™ and the in-memory performance of Apache Spark™. The cost-based optimizer uses advanced statistics to choose the best compute engine, storage engine, index access, join order and join algorithm for each task. In this way, Splice Machine can concurrently process transactional and analytical workloads at scale.</p>
            <h2>Getting Started With our Database Service</h2>
            <p>Getting started with our database is as simple as can be:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Create an account using our interface or with your Google or Amazon accounts.</li>
                <li>Provision a database with our simple interface, featuring just 4 sliders to configure your cluster for your needs. Our <a href="dbaas_cm_initialstartup.html">cluster creation</a> page walks you through this simple process.</li>
                <li>Wait 10-15 minutes for your database to be ready. You'll receive an email that includes links to your database dashboard, notebooks, and management console, as well as the link you can use to access your database via JDBC or ODBC.</li>
                <li>Use an existing notebook or create a new one to interact with your database. Load your data, write SQL queries, stream data to and from third-party applications, and use the power of Apache Zeppelin to visualize, share, and collaborate on your queries. Your Notebooks page is already populated with a number of tutorials, including one that shows you how to start using and creating Zeppelin notebooks.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2 id="serviceconfig">Service Configuration</h2>
            <p>The Splice Machine Database Service is subscription-based, which means that you pay a monthly fee that is based on the configuration you've chosen. Factors that affect the cost of your service include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The number of <span class="ConsoleLink">Splice Units</span>. A Splice unit is a measure of processing work; one unit currently translates (approximately)&#160;to 2 virtual CPUs and 16 GB&#160;of memory. When you provision a new Splice Machine cluster, you can select the number of Splice Units you want to use for OLAP and OLTP workloads. The minimum number of Splice Units required for your cluster changes when the amount of </li>
                <li>The space allocated for your <span class="ConsoleLink">Internal Dataset</span>, which is data that you're storing within your database. Note that as this size increases, the number of Splice Units required (especially OLTP Splice Units) can also increase.</li>
                <li>The space allocated for your <span class="ConsoleLink">External Dataset</span>, which is data stored externally that you can access from your database using features such as external tables and VTI. Note that as this size increases, the number of OLAP Splice Units required can also increase.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can learn more about configuring your database in our <a href="dbaas_cm_initialstartup.html">cluster creation</a>. Or simply click <span class="ConsoleLink">Create Cluster</span> in your Splice Machine Database Service dashboard.
