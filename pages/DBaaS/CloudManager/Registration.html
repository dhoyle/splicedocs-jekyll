            <p>As you can see, the registration process is familiar; you can use your Google or Amazon account information to register, or you can manually register:</p>
            <div class="opsStepsList">
                <ol>
                    <li>Enter your first and last name.</li>
                    <li>Enter and then confirm the email address you want to use for logging into the Splice Machine Cloud Manager.</li>
                    <li>Enter and then confirm the password you want to use for logging into the Splice Machine Cloud Manager.</li>
                    <li>Click the <span class="CalloutFont">Register</span> button.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>Once you've successfully registered, you'll land on the <span class="ItalicFont">Create New Cluster</span> screen; we've created tutorials to quickly walk you through that process:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you're registering to create a free trial cluster to experiment with Splice&#160;Machine, see our <a href="dbaas_cm_initialstartup.html">Initial Setup</a> topic.</li>
                <li>If you're registering to create a free trial cluster to experiment with Splice&#160;Machine, see our <a href="dbaas_cm_trialstartup.html">Free Trial Setup</a> topic instead.</li>
            </ul>
