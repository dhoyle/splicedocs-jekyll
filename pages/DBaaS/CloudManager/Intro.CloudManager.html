                            <li>If you don't yet know how to create an S3 bucket or upload data to a bucket, please check our <a href="tutorials_ingest_uploadtos3.html">Uploading Data to an S3 Bucket</a> tutorial.</li>
                            <li>You may need to configure IAM&#160;permissions to allow Splice Machine to access your bucket; see our <a href="tutorials_ingest_configures3.html">Configuring an S3 Bucket for Splice Machine Access</a> tutorial.</li>
                            <li>Once you've got your data in a bucket, you can follow our <a href="tutorials_ingest_importing.html">Importing Data</a> tutorial to load that data into Splice&#160;Machine.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Also note that the S3 directory you specify for the log of record import issues (the <span class="ItalicFont">bad record</span> directory), must be write-accessible using the same AWS credentials that apply to the input directory, i.e. the bad record directory must allow the same access key/secret key pair.</p>
