                            <li>If you don't yet know how to create an S3 bucket or upload data to a bucket, please check our <a href="tutorials_ingest_uploadtos3.html">Uploading Data to an S3 Bucket</a> tutorial.</li>
                            <li>You may need to configure IAM&#160;permissions to allow Splice Machine to access your bucket; see our <a href="tutorials_ingest_configures3.html">Configuring an S3 Bucket for Splice Machine Access</a> tutorial.</li>
                            <li>Once you've got your data in a bucket, you can follow our <a href="tutorials_ingest_importing.html">Importing Data</a> tutorial to load that data into Splice&#160;Machine.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Also note that the S3 directory you specify for the log of record import issues (the <span class="ItalicFont">bad record</span> directory), must be write-accessible using the same AWS credentials that apply to the input directory, i.e. the bad record directory must allow the same access key/secret key pair.</p>

                        <p>The <span class="ItalicFont">Splice Machine Database Console</span> is a browser-based tool that you can use to monitor database queries on your cluster in real time. The Console UI&#160;allows you to see the Spark queries that are currently running in Splice Machine on your cluster, and to then drill down into each job to see the current progress of the queries, and to identify any potential bottlenecks. If you see something amiss, you can also terminate a query.</p>
						<p>The DB Console is available for all Splice Machine products; you access the Splice DB Console for the Database-as-Service product by clicking the <span class="ConsoleLink">DB Console</span> link in your Cluster Management dashboard, or by following the link sent to you by Splice Machine when your cluster was originally created.</p>
						<div class="noteIcon"><span class="ConsoleLink">DB Console</span> link in your Cluster Management dashboard allows you to monitor Splice Machine jobs running on your cluster. If you are running non-Splice jobs, you'll need to use a different console to monitor them; you'll find a link to this <span class="ConsoleLink">External Spark Console</span> in the bottom left corner of your cluster dashboard.</div>

                        <p>One of the great features of our database service is the ease with which you can use Apache Zeppelin notebooks to interact with your database. This tutorial walks you through using a notebook created by Splice Machine that:</p>

                            <li>Creates a schema and the tables in your database to store the TPCH-1 benchmarks data.</li>
