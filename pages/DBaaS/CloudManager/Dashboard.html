        <h1>Exploring Your Cloud Manager Dashboard</h1>
        <div class="noteDBaaSOnly">The topics in this guide are only relevant to users of our database-as-a-service product.</div>
        <p>This topic describes the actions you can initiate from your Splice&#160;Machine dashboard, which include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating a New Cluster</li>
            <li>Managing Your&#160;Cluster</li>
            <li>Modifying Your Cluster</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Creating a New Cluster</h2>
        <p>Initial</p>
        <p>
            <src="images/InitialDashboard.png" class="indentedTightSpacing" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Viewing Your Clusters</h2>
        <p>When you create a new cluster, you land back on this Dashboard screen, which shows you the status of your current clusters. In the following image, we've created our first Splice&#160;Machine cluster, which is currently initializing.</p>
        <p>
            <src="images/JustCreatedDashboard.png" class="indentedTightSpacing" />
        </p>
        <p>Once your new cluster is initialized, its status changes to <span class="ConsoleLink">Active</span>, and you receive an email message from&#160;Splice&#160;Machine notifying you that your cluster is ready. At that point, you can click the cluster name (e.g. <span class="ItalicFont">SpliceDocs1</span>)&#160;to reveal the cluster management screen.</p>
        <h2>Managing A Cluster</h2>
        <p>The cluster management screen displays information about the cluster, and includes three panels that display a graph of resource usage over time. There are three similar resource usage graphs displayed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CPU&#160;Percentage Used (shown in the following image)</li>
            <li>Disk Usage</li>
            <li>Memory Usage</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="spaceAbove">
            <src="images/ActiveDashboard1.png" class="indentedTightSpacing" />
        </p>
        <p>At the very bottom of the Cluster Management screen, below the three graph panels, is the URL&#160;you can use for a JDBC&#160;connection with your database service:</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2>Modifying Your Cluster</h2>
        <p>Your dashboard features three cluster modification choices; you can <span class="ConsoleLink">Reconfigure</span>, <span class="ConsoleLink">Resize</span>, or <span class="ConsoleLink">Delete</span> your cluster by clicking one of the buttons near the top-left of your Dashboard screen:</p>
        <p>
            <src="images/DashboardButtons.png" class="indentedTightSpacing" />
        </p>
        <h3>Reconfiguring Your Cluster</h3>
        <p>To reconfigure your cluster, click the <span class="ConsoleLink">Reconfigure</span> button. </p>
        <p>TBD</p>
        <h3>Resizing Your Cluster</h3>
        <p>To resize your cluster, click the <span class="ConsoleLink">Resize</span> button. </p>
        <p>TBD</p>
        <h3>Deleting Your Cluster</h3>
        <p>To delete your cluster, click the <span class="ConsoleLink">Delete</span> button. </p>
        <p>TBD</p>
        <h2>Working With Your Database</h2>
        <p>Your dashboard includes buttons with which you can access two different means of working with your database; you can launch the <span class="CalloutFont">DB&#160;Console</span> or the Apache Zeppelin <span class="CalloutFont">Notebook</span> interface by clicking one of the buttons near the upper-right corner of the Dashboard screen:</p>
        <p>
            <src="images/DashboardLinks.png" class="indentedTightSpacing" />
        </p>
        <p>Click the DB&#160;Console button to land on our <a href="dbaas_dbconsole_intro.html">Database Console</a> interface.</p>
        <p>Click the Notebook button to land on our <a href="dbaas_zep_intro.html">Zeppelin Notebook</a> interface.</p>
