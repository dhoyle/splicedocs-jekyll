        <h1>Exploring Your Cloud Manager Dashboard</h1>
        <p>This topic describes the actions you can initiate from your Splice&#160;Machine dashboard, which include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#creating">Creating a New Cluster</a></li>
            <li><a href="#viewing">Viewing and Managing Your&#160;Clusters</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="creating">Creating a New Cluster</h2>
        <p>Click the large <span class="ConsoleLink">Create New Cluster</span> button to start the process of creating a new cluster. This process, which requires just a few minutes, is described in detail in our <a href="dbaas_cm_initialstartup.html">Creating a New Cluster</a> topic.

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2 id="viewing">Viewing and Managing Your Clusters</h2>
        <p>When you create a new cluster, you land back on this Dashboard screen, which shows you the status of your current clusters. In the following image, we've created our first Splice&#160;Machine cluster, which is currently <em>Initializing</em>.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Once your new cluster is initialized, its status changes to <em>Active</em>, and you receive an email message from&#160;Splice&#160;Machine notifying you that your cluster is ready. At that point, you can click the cluster name (e.g. <em>SpliceDocs1</em>)&#160;to use the <em>Cluster Management</em> screen for that cluster.</p>
		<p class="noteNote">If you have multiple clusters associated with your account, each will be listed in your dashboard. Simply click or tap a cluster name to jump to its management screen.</p>
