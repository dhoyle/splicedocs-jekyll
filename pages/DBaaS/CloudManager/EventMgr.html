        <h1>Managing Your Event Notifications</h1>
{% include splice_snippets/dbaasonlytopic.html %}
        <p>This topic describes the Splice Machine Events Manager, which allows you to examine notification messages sent to your cluster.</p>
            <p>Here's a screenshot of a partially populated <span class="ConsoleLink">Events Manager screen:</span></p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>You can initiate these actions in the Events Manager:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Display messages for one specific cluster, or all of your clusters; in the screenshot above, events are displayed for the cluster named <em>GaryDocs2</em>.</li>
            <li><p>Filter which messages are displayed; enter filter criteria, then click the <span class="CalloutFont">Filter</span> button. You can filter on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A start date.</li>
                    <li>An end date.</li>
                    <li>A keyword or exact phrase.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can filter on a start date or end date on its own, or combine them together to specify a date range. You can also combine a date or date-range filter with a keyword filter to find only events that meet the combined criteria.</p>
            </li>
            <li>You can click the <span class="CalloutFont">Clear Filter</span> button to clear any filters and display all of your notification messages.</li>
            <li>Click the <span class="CalloutFont">&lt;</span> (Prev), <span class="CalloutFont">&gt;</span> (Next), <span class="CalloutFont">&lt;&lt;</span> (First), or <span class="CalloutFont">&gt;&gt;</span> (Last) buttons to move through multiple screenfuls of messages.</li>
            <li>Click the arrow to the right of a message to display the full or shortened version of the message.</li>
        </ul>
