# Exploring Your Cloud Manager Dashboard

This topic describes the actions you can initiate from your
Splice Machine dashboard, which include:

* [Creating a New Cluster](#creating)
* [Viewing and Managing Your Clusters](#viewing)

## Creating a New Cluster   {#creating}

Click the large <span class="ConsoleLink">Create New Cluster</span>
button to start the process of creating a new cluster. This process,
which requires just a few minutes, is described in detail in our
[Creating a New Cluster](dbaas_cm_initialstartup.html) topic.

## Viewing and Managing Your Clusters   {#viewing}

When you create a new cluster, you land back on this Dashboard screen,
which shows you the status of your current clusters. In the following
image, we've created our first Splice Machine cluster, which is
currently *Initializing*.

Once your new cluster is initialized, its status changes to *Active*,
and you receive an email message from Splice Machine notifying you that
your cluster is ready. At that point, you can click the cluster name
(e.g. *SpliceDocs1*) to use the *Cluster Management* screen for that
cluster.

If you have multiple clusters associated with your account, each will be
listed in your dashboard. Simply click or tap a cluster name to jump to
its management screen.
