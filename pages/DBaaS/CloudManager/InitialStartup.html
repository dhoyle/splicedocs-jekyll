{% include splice_snippets/dbaasonlytopic.html %}
        <p>When you first visit your new Splice&#160;Machine Cloud Manager dashboard, you'll see the initial dashboard view, which prompts you to create a new cluster:</p>

       </p>
       <p>Click  <span class="ConsoleLink">Create New Cluster</span> to start the process of provisioning your Splice Machine cluster. You'll then need to:</p>
       <ol>
           <li><a href="#Configure">Configure Cluster Parameters</a> for data sizing, cluster power, and backup frequency.</li>

            <p>This page describes how to use the Splice Machine Cloud Manager to create a cluster; it covers both the full (non-trial)&#160;and trial versions of the Splice&#160;Machine Database Service.</p>

           <h2 id="Configure">Configure Cluster Parameters</h2>
           <p>You use the <span class="ConsoleLink">Create New Cluster</span> screen to provision your cluster:</p>

           </p>
		   <p>Many of the components on this screen, like most of our Cloud Manager screens, include small information buttons <img src="images/infobutton.png" class="icon36"> that you can click to display a small pop-up that describes the components.</p>
           <h3>About the Cluster Parameters</h3>
           <p>You'll notice several sliders that you can adjust to modify the configuration of your cluster. As you move these sliders, you'll see how the estimated monthly costs for your cluster change. Here are explanations of the adjustments you can make to your cluster provisioning:</p>
            <div class="noteNote">Note that you can come back and modify your cluster configuration in the future, so you're not stuck forever with your initial settings.</div>

           <h3>Modifying Cluster Parameters</h3>
           <p>We recommend that you spend a few minutes experimenting with modifying the cluster parameters; you'll notice that as you increase various values, the estimated monthly cost of your cluster changes. </p>
           <p>When you're satisfied with your cluster configuration parameters, click the <span class="CalloutFont">Next</span> button to set up access to your cluster.</p>
		   <p>You'll notice that when you increase some values, Splice Machine may indicate that the current setting for a parameter clashes with a change that you've made. For example, in the following image, we have increased the <span class="ConsoleLink">Internal Dataset</span> size to 20 TB, and as a result the <span class="ConsoleLink">Cluster Power</span> values are no longer adequate to support that large a dataset, as indicated by the striping:</p>
		   <p>
               <img src="images/CreateNewCluster2.png" class="indentedTightSpacing" title="Modified cluster parameters" />
           </p>
		   <p>Splice Machine will not allow you to create your cluster if any of your values clash. You can click the vertical bar at the end of the striping to instantly set the parameter to the required value.</p>
           <div class="noteNote"> If you don't correct the required setting and attempt to advance to the <span class="CalloutFont">Next</span> screen, you'll see an error message and will be unable to advance until you do correct it.</div>
           <h2 id="Configur">Configure Cluster Access</h2>
           <p>Once you've configured your cluster, click the <span class="CalloutFont">Next</span> button to display the <span class="ConsoleLink">Cluster Access</span> screen. The following image includes displays of the pop-up help information displays for the different access methods:</p>

           </p>
           <p>You can set your cluster up for access to your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)&#160;access by selecting the <span class="CodeFont">Client&#160;VPC&#160;connectivity required</span> option and providing your VPC&#160;account ID. </p>
           <p>You need to configure AWS&#160;Identity and Access Management (IAM) for your cluster to allow Splice&#160;Machine to access selected S3 folders; this is described in our <a href="tutorials_ingest_configures3.html">Configuring an S3 bucket for Splice Machine Acces</a> tutorial.</p>

           <p>After clicking the Launch button:</p>
		   <ul>

           <p>After your cluster spins up, which typically requires about 10 minutes, you can load your data into your&#160;Splice Machine database from an S3 bucket:</p>

               <li>If you don't yet know how to create an S3 bucket or upload data to a bucket, please check our <a href="tutorials_ingest_uploadtos3.html">Uploading Data to an S3 Bucket</a> tutorial.</li>
               <li>You may need to configure IAM&#160;permissions to allow Splice Machine to access your bucket; see our <a href="tutorials_ingest_configures3.html">Configuring an S3 Bucket for Splice Machine Access</a> tutorial.</li>
               <li>Once you've got your data in a bucket, you can follow our <a href="tutorials_ingest_importing.html">Importing Data</a> tutorial to load that data into Splice&#160;Machine.</li>
