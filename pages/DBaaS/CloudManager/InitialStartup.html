        <h1>Creating a New Splice Machine Cluster</h1>
        <div class="noteNote">
            <p>This page describes how to use the Splice Machine Cloud Manager to create a cluster; it covers both the full (non-trial)&#160;and trial versions of the Splice&#160;Machine Database Service.</p>
        </div>
        <p>When you first visit your new Splice&#160;Machine Cloud Manager dashboard, you'll see the initial dashboard view, which prompts you to create a new cluster:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="images/PaymentAuthCode.png" class="tableCell450" title="Paying with an authorization code" />
                        </p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>Once you submit your payment, your cluster will be provisioned and initialized; this typically requires about 10-15 minutes. While it's initializing, your dashboard will show that the cluster is initializing. When initialization is done and your cluster is ready for you, Splice Machine will notify via email, and will display a notification on your Dashboard screen</p>

        </p>
        <p>We invite you to review our <a href="dbaas_cm_dashboard.html">Exploring Your Dashboard</a> topic to learn more about your dashboard.</p>
        <h4>Modifying Payment Information</h4>
        <p>If you ever need to change your payment information, you can update it in the <span class="ConsoleLink">Billing Activity</span> tab of the <span class="ConsoleLink">Account</span> screen; just click the <span class="CalloutFont">Update</span> button to revisit the <span class="ConsoleLink">Payment</span> screen:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="images/BillingActivity.png" title="Billing Activity tab of the Account screen" class="indentedTightSpacing" style="width: 729px;height: 348px;" />
        </p>
        <h2 id="Load"></a>Load Your Data!</h2>
        <p>Splice Machine recommends using Apache Zeppelin notebooks to interact with your database. We <a href="dbaas_zep_TPCH1.html">have created a notebook that will load and run the TPCH-1 benchmark queries</a>, all with the click of a button. You can use that notebook as a model for creating your own.</p>
        <p>Once your cluster is ready, you can easily load your data into your&#160;Splice Machine database from an S3 bucket:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you don't yet know how to create an S3 bucket or upload data to a bucket, please check our <a href="tutorials_ingest_uploadtos3.html">Uploading Data to an S3 Bucket</a> tutorial.</li>
            <li>You may need to configure IAM&#160;permissions to allow Splice Machine to access your bucket; see our <a href="tutorials_ingest_configures3.html">Configuring an S3 Bucket for Splice Machine Access</a> tutorial.</li>
            <li>Once you've got your data in a bucket, you can follow our <a href="tutorials_ingest_importing.html">Importing Data</a> tutorial to load that data into Splice&#160;Machine.</li>
        </ul>
