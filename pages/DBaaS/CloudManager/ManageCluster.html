        <h1>Managing a Cluster</h1>
        <p>This topic describes the actions you can initiate from the <span class="ConsoleLink">Cluster Management</span> screen, which include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#managing">Viewing the cluster's CPU, Disk, and Memory Usage</a></li>
            <li><a href="#reconfiguring">Reconfiguring cluster access</a></li>
            <li><a href="#resizing">Resizing your cluster</a></li>
			<li><a href="#deleting">Deleting your cluster</a></li>
			<li><a href="working">Using Zeppelin and the Database Console with your cluster</a></li>
        </ul>
		<h2>The Cluster Management Screen</h2>
        <p>You can access the <span class="ConsoleLink">Cluster Management</span> screen for any cluster in your Dashboard by simply clicking the name of the cluster.<p>
		<p>This screen displays information about the cluster, and includes three panels that display a graph of resource usage over time. There are three similar resource usage graphs displayed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CPU&#160;Percentage Used (shown in the following image)</li>
            <li>Disk Usage</li>
            <li>Memory Usage</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <h2 id="modifying">Modifying Your Cluster</h2>
        <p>Your dashboard features three cluster modification choices; you can <a href="reconfiguring">Reconfiguring</a>, <a href="Resizing">Resizing</a>, or <a href="Deleting">Deleting</a> your cluster by clicking one of the buttons near the top-left of your Dashboard screen:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="images/DashboardButtons.png" class="indentedTightSpacing" />
        </p>
        <h3 id="reconfiguring">Reconfiguring Your Cluster</h3>
        <p>To reconfigure your cluster, click the <span class="ConsoleLink">Reconfigure</span> button; the cluster reconfiguration screen displays: </p>
        <p>
            <img src="images/Reconfigure1.png" class="indentedTightSpacing" />
        </p>
        <p>You can modify your VPC and/or IAM configuration information in this screen. Once you've entered your new information, click the <span class="CalloutFont">Reconfigure</span> button to update your configuration and return to your Cluster Management screen.</p>
        <h3 id="resizing">Resizing Your Cluster</h3>
        <p>To resize your cluster, click the <span class="CalloutFont">Resize</span> button. The Resize Cluster screen, which is pretty much identical to the Create New Cluster screen, displays:</p>
        <p><img src="images/ResizeCluster.png" class="indentedTightSpacing" /></p>
        <p>You can adjust your cluster parameters, then click the <span class="CalloutFont">Resize</span> button, which will return you to your Cluster Management screen, where you'll see the status of your cluster set to <em>Updating</em>.</p>
        <h3 id="deleting">Deleting Your Cluster</h3>
        <p>To delete your cluster, click the <span class="CalloutFont">Delete</span> button. You'll be ask to confirm the deletion:</p>
        <p><img src="images/ClusterDelete.png" class="indentedTightSpacing" /></p>
        <p>After confirming that you want to do so, your cluster will be deleted, and its status in your dashboard will show as <em>Deleted</em>.</p>
        <h2 id="working">Working With Your Database</h2>
        <p>Your dashboard includes buttons with which you can access two different means of working with your database; you can launch the <span class="CalloutFont">DB&#160;Console</span> or the Apache Zeppelin <span class="CalloutFont">Notebook</span> interface by clicking one of the buttons near the upper-right corner of the Dashboard screen:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="images/DashboardLinks.png" class="indentedTightSpacing" />
        </p>
        <p>Click the <span class="CalloutFont">DB&#160;Console</span> button to land on our <a href="dbconsole_intro.html">Database Console</a> interface.</p>
        <p>Click the <span class="CalloutFont">Notebook</span> button to land on our <a href="dbaas_zep_intro.html">Zeppelin Notebook</a> interface.</p>
		<h3>Connecting to Your Database with JDBC</h3>
        <p>At the very bottom of the Cluster Management screen, below the three graph panels, is the URL&#160;you can use for a JDBC&#160;connection with your database service:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="images/ActiveDashboard2.png" class="indentedTightSpacing" />
        </p>
		<p class="noteIcon">The same JDBC link was emailed to you in the message from Splice Machine letting you know that your cluster creation was successful.</p>
