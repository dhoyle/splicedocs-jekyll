# Splice Machine Machine Learning Manager

Our [Using the MLManager](mlmanager_using.html) topic provides an overview of how MLManager simplifies and enhances the process of developing, tuning, and deploying your Machine Learning projects. The remainder of this section contains documentation for the Splice Machine Machine Learning Manager (*MLManager*), which includes these components:

* [The *Splice Native DataSource*](XXX.html) provides a highly performant direct API between Splice Machine database tables and Spark DataFrames that is integrated with Zeppelin.
* [Zeppelin Notebooks](xxx.html) allow you to produce data science solutions in various languages that include rapid query and visualization capabilities.
* You have full access to the [Spark Distributed Machine Learning Library (MLlib)](xxx.html), which you can use with Scala or Python.
* You can use the [H2O libraries](xxx.html) adds machine learning capabilities such as deep learning, TensorFlow integration, GLM, GBM, XBoox, and AutoML. And *H2O Sparkling Water* provides access to H2O algorithms from Spark.
* [MLflow Workflow Management](xxx.html) is a tracking API that manages experiments, includes reporting, and tracks pipeline artifacts for later deployment. Your MLflow models can be saved to Docker images, which can then be deployed with SageMaker.
* [SageMaker Deployment Integration](xxx.html) manages deployment of your models, including auto-scaling and load balancing, and exposes RESTful APIs.
