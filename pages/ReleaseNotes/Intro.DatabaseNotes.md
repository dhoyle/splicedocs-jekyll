# Release Notes for Splice Machine

Welcome to the {{site.build_version}} Release of Splice Machine, originally released  {{site.release_date}}. The release notes for our database are presented in these topics:

* <a href="releasenotes_newfeatures.html">New Features and Changes</a>
* <a href="releasenotes_improvements.html">Improvements</a>
* <a href="releasenotes_bugfixes.html">Issues Fixed</a>
* <a href="releasenotes_workarounds.html">Limitations and Workarounds</a>

Each of the above topics contains the release notes for the initial Release, along with links to release notes for incremental (patch) versions that have been released since then.

Splice Machine Release 2.6 was an interim release in September, 2017, which coincided with the initial Release of our Database-as-a-Service product. All changes in v2.6 have been incorporated into the 2.7 Release of the Splice Machine database.
