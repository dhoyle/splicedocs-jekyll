# Release Notes for Splice Machine

Welcome to the {{splvar_basic_SpliceReleaseVersion}} release of Splice Machine, originally released  {{splvar_basic_CustDocReleaseDate}}. The release notes for our database are presented in these topics:

* <a href="releasenotes_newfeatures.html">New Features and Changes</a>
* <a href="releasenotes_improvements.html">Improvements</a>
* <a href="releasenotes_bugfixes.html">Issues Fixed</a>
* <a href="releasenotes_workarounds.html">Limitations and Workarounds</a>

Each of the above topics contains the release notes for the initial release, along with links to release notes for incremental (patch) versions that have been released since then.
