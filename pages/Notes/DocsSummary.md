# Using the Splice Machine Documentation

This topic helps orient you to the Splice Machine documentation, in
these sections:

* [Splice Machine Layout](#Navigation) explains the layout of our
  documentation web and shows you how to use the various navigation
  tools to land on the pages in which you're interested.
* [Navigating our Documentation](#ContentDesc) summarizes and links to
  all of the top-level sections in the Splice Machine documentation
  suite.

## Splice Machine Layout   {#Navigation}

Here's an image of the top portion of our documentation screen, which is
called the *topbar*:

The topbar features these elements:

* Click the *Splice Machine Documentation* title to return you to the
  home page of our documentation.
* Click the [Navigation Toggle](#navswitch) to toggle the sidebar off
  (to expand the width of the main content) or off.
* The [top navigation menus](#topnavmenus) includes our three main
  menus, which link to the main topic sections.
* A [sidebar](#sidebar) for navigating to topics within the main
  sections.
* A [search bar](#searchbar) that you can use to search for topic titles
  within the documentation.
* The [main content area](#contentareea), which contains the content of
  each topic.

## Navigating our Documentation

This site includes documentation for both of our Splice Machine
products. The topic sections are organized into three main categories,
each of which has detailed sections and is represented by one of the
menus at the top of each page (*Splice Machine, DB-Service Only,
On-Premise-DB Only*). The sidebar navigation (on the left) automatically
changes whenever you select a new section of the docs.
