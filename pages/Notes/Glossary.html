						ACID (<strong>A</strong>tomicity, <strong>C</strong>onsistency, <strong>I</strong>solation, <strong>D</strong>urability) is a set of properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably. In the context of databases, a single logical operation on the data is called a transaction.
					<ul><li><em>Atomicity </em>means that if one part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction fails.</li><li><em>Consistency </em>ensures that any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another, which means that any data written to the database must be valid according all rules defined in the database.</li><li><em>Isolation </em>ensures that the concurrent execution of transactions results in a system state that would be obtained if transactions were executed in serial order.</li><li><em>Durability </em>means that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of power loss, crashes, or errors.</li></ul></td>

						Part of the Apache Hadoop framework, ZooKeeper provides a centralized infrastructure and services that enable synchronization across a cluster. ZooKeeper maintains common objects needed in large cluster environments. Examples of these objects include configuration information, hierarchical naming space, and so on. Applications can leverage these services to coordinate distributed processing across large clusters.</td>
