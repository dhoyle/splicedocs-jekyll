            <p>The topbar features these elements:</p>
			<ul>

				<li>The <a href="#topnavmenus">top navigation menus</a> includes our three main menus, which link to the main topic sections.</li>
				<li>A <a href="#sidebar">sidebar</a> for navigating to topics within the main sections.</li>
				<li>A <a href="#searchbar">search bar</a> that you can use to search for topic titles within the documentation.</li>
				<li>The <a href="#contentareea">main content area</a>, which contains the content of each topic.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Navigating our Documentation</h2>
			<p>This site includes documentation for both of our Splice Machine products. The topic sections are organized into three main categories, each of which has detailed sections and is represented by one of the menus at the top of each page (<span class="ItalicFont">Splice Machine, DB-Service Only, On-Premise-DB Only</span>). The sidebar navigation (on the left) automatically changes whenever you select a new section of the docs.
