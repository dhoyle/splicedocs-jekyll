Cluster uptime is only being supported M-F 9am-5pm PDT.  Additionally, clusters may be brought down at the end of the week for updates.  If done so, your cluster may be lost and you will need to recreate it and repopulate your data.  Scheduled outages will be posted to your UI Console.
At this time, cluster sizes should be kept below 1TB internal storage, 4 OLTP Splice Units, and 4 OLAP Splice Units.
