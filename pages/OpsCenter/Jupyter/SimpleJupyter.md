# A Simple Jupyter Tutorial

This topic walks you through using a very simple Jupyter notebook, to
help you learn about using Jupyter with the Splice Machine database service.

{% include splice_snippets/dbaasonlytopic.md %}

Our [Getting Started with Jupyter](dbaas_jup_getstarted.html) page
provides a very brief overview of using Jupyter; If you're new to
Jupyter, we strongly encourage you to visit the [Jupyter documentation
site][1]{: target="_blank"} to learn about creating, modifying, and
running your own Jupyter notebooks.

## Running the Tutorial Notebook

To run the first notebook in our tutorials section, follow these steps:

1. Log into your Jupyter server, which lands you on the Jupyter dashboard.
2. Select the *splice notebooks* folder:

3. Select the *Tutorials* folder:

4. Select the *Jupyter Notebook Basics* notebook:

5. You'll now be viewing that notebook:

6. Run each cell in the notebook: click in the cell to activate it, and then either press *Shift+Enter* or click the *Run* icon in the Jupyter toolbar.

   The cells in this notebook are self-explanatory; running each will introduce you to the basics of working with Jupyter notebooks.
