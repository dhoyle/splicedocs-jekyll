# Managing Queries with the DB Console

The Splice Machine Database Console allows you to view queries that are
currently running and have completed running in your database. You
typically start at the top level, viewing jobs, and then drill down into
individual job details, job stages, and task details, as described in
these sections:

* [Viewing Summary Pages](#Viewing4) describes the console's top-level
  summary pages.
* [Viewing Job Details](#Viewing) describes the pages in which you can
  view details of active or completed jobs.
* [Viewing Stage Details](#Viewing2) describes the pages in which you
  can view details of active and completed stages.
* [Terminating a Stage](#Terminat) shows you how to terminate a job
  stage that is not performing as you think it should.

## Viewing Summary Pages   {#Viewing4}

The console includes five summary pages, each of which can be accessed
from the tab bar at the top of the console window:

* [The Jobs Summary page](#The2) shows information about all active and
  completed jobs.
* [The Stages Summary Page](#The3) shows all stages for all jobs, both
  active and completed.
* [The Storage Summary Page](#The4) shows any RDDs that you have
  persisted or cached to memory.
* [The Environment Summary Page](#The5) shows information about the
  Spark run-time environment.
* [The Executors Summary Page](#The6) shows the executors that are
  currently running.

### The Jobs Summary page   {#The2}

The *Jobs Summary Page* is the top-level view in the Splice Machine
Database Console, It shows you a summary of any currently active and all
completed jobs.

You land on this page when you first view the *Database Console* in your
browser, and you can view it at any time by clicking the <span
class="AppCommand">Jobs</span> tab in the tab bar at the top of the
page.

.indentedTightSpacing}

A stage is shown as skipped when the data has been fetched from a cache
and there was no need to reexecute the stage; this happens when
shuffling data because the Spark engine automatically caches generated
data.
{: .noteNote}

You can click the a job description name (in <span
class="ConsoleLink">blue</span>) to view job details of any job in the
<span class="AppCommand">Active Jobs</span> or <span
class="AppCommand">Completed Jobs</span> sections.

### The Stages Summary Page   {#The3}

The *StagesSummary Page* shows you the available scheduling pools, and a
summary of the stages for all active and completed jobs. You can access
this page by clicking the <span class="AppCommand">Stages</span> tab in
the tab bar at the top of the window.

![Spark UI stages summary for all
jobs](images/SparkUIStagesAllJobs.png){: .indentedTightSpacing}

You can click the descriptive name of a stage (in <span
class="ConsoleLink">blue</span>) to view the stage details.

The <span class="AppCommand">Fair Scheduler Pools</span> section at the
top of the page shows the name and weighting value for each of the
scheduler pools that have been defined for your database jobs.

### The Storage Summary Page   {#The4}

The *Storage Summary Page* displays information about any RDDs that are
currently persisted or cached. You can access this page by clicking the
<span class="AppCommand">Storage</span> tab in the tab bar at the top of
the window:

### The Environment Summary Page   {#The5}

The *Environment Summary Page* displays information about which software
versions you're using, and shows the values of the Spark-related
environment variables. You can access this page by clicking the <span
class="AppCommand">Environment</span> tab in the tab bar at the top of
the window:

![Spark UI environment summary page](images/SparkUIEnviroment.png){:
.indentedTightSpacing}

### The Executors Summary Page   {#The6}

The *Executors Summary Page* shows you the Spark executors that are
currently running. You can access this page by clicking the <span
class="AppCommand">Executors</span> tab in the tab bar at the top of the
window:

![Spark UI executors summary page](images/SparkUIExecutors.png){:
.indentedTightSpacing}

You can click <span class="ConsoleLink">Thread Dump</span> to display a
thread dump for an executor, or you can click a log name to see the
contents of the log.

## Viewing Job Details   {#Viewing}

If you click a job to see its details, you'll see a screen like the
following displayed, which shows the stages of the job:

![Splice Database Console Spark Job Details
screen](images/SparkUIJobdetails2.png){: .indentedTightSpacing}

You can expand the job detail display by selecting the <span
class="ConsoleLink">Event Timeline</span> and/or <span
class="ConsoleLink">DAG Visualization</span> buttons.

### Job Details Event Time Line View    {#Job}

The job details time-line view looks like the following screen shot:

![Event timeline view of a Spark
job](images/SparkUIJobDetailsTimeline.png){: .indentedTightSpacing}

 

### Job Details Graphical Visualization View   {#Query}

The DAG Visualization view for a job looks like this:

![DAG view of a Spark job](images/SparkUIJobDetailsDAG.png){:
.indentedTightSpacing}

Some key things to know about the DAG view are:

* You can click in the box representing a stage to view the detailed
  tasks within that stage. For an example, see [Graphical View of the
  Tasks in a Stage](#Graphica), in the next section.

* You can hover over any of the black dots inside a task box to display
  information about the task. For example:

  ![Spark UI hovering over a task node](images/SparkUIHoverDAG.png){:
  .nestedTightSpacing}

## Viewing Stage Details   {#Viewing2}

Viewing stage details is very much the same as viewing job details. If
you click the name of a stage in another page, the detailed view of that
stage displays:

.indentedTightSpacing}

### The Event Time Line View of a Stage   {#The}

The Event Timeline view of a stage looks like this:

![Timeline view of a Spark job
stage](images/SparkUIStageDetailsTimeline.png){: .indentedTightSpacing}

### Graphical View of the Tasks in a Stage   {#Graphica}

The DAG Visualization view of a stage looks like this:

![Graphical view of a Spark job
stage](images/SparkUIStageDetailsDAG.png){: .indentedTightSpacing}

## Terminating a Stage   {#Terminat}

If you conclude that an active job stage is not performing the way you
think it should, you can terminate a stage by clicking the <span
class="AppCommand">Kill</span> button shown in the description of every
active stage. The following image highlights the kill buttons that
you'll find in the console display:

![Finding the Kill button in the Spark
UI](images/SparkUIKillStage.png){: .indentedTightSpacing}

You'll be prompted to verify that you want the stage terminated:

![Verifying that a stage should be terminated in the Spark
UI](images/SparkUIKillVerify.png){: .indentedTightSpacing}

You can access the <span class="AppCommand">Kill</span> button by
drilling down into a job's stages, or by selecting the <span
class="AppCommand">Stages</span> tab in the tab bar, which displays all
stages for all jobs.
