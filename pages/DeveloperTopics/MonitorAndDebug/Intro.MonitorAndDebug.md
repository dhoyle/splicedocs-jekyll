This section of the documentation previously contained information about using [statistics](bestpractices_optimizer_intro.html), [explain plans](bestpractices_optimizer_explain.html), and [optimizer hints](bestpractices_optimizer_hints.html) to examine and improve the performance of your queries. An enhanced version of that information is now found in the [*Best Practices - Optimization*](bestpractices_optimizer_intro.html) section of this documentation.
