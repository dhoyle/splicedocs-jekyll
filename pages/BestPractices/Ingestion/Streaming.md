# ï»¿Best Practices: Ingesting Streaming Data
This topic presents two versions of an example of using Spark streaming to ingest real-time data from Internet-connected devices (IOT) into a Splice Machine table in these steps: one version that runs in a Zeppelin notebook, and a second version that runs via spark-submit.

For an overview of best practices for data ingestion, see [Best Practices: Ingesting Data](bestpractices_ingest_overview.html), in this Best Practices chapter.
